  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p><em>PhD, Technology | MS, Technology | MS, Horticulture | BS, Biology</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left"><b>Biosensor-controlled Interactive Environments for Virtual Reality</b> | PhD coursework<br /> Collaborated on an interactive and immersive VR environment involving user biofeedback to control a helicopter in an outdoor scene. My colleague created the hardware interface while I created the models, environment, and interactions. A stretch sensor worn around the abdomen allowed the user to drive several inputs for environmental lighting, helicopter altitude, and on-craft lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>Evaluation of Dead-reckoning Ability in Immersive Virtual Environments</b> | PhD coursework<br /> Collaborated on a simple VR testing environment and corresponding research program to evaluate users' ability to determine distances and positions in a flat scene with several levels of navigational cues. Users were scored on their ability to travel in a prescribed manner using temporary targets and to then return to the origin.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>In?uence of Interactive Spatial Problem Solving on Spatial Test Performance</b> | PhD coursework<br /> Developed a pilot test to examine the ability of interactive spatial problem solving within game play to influence user scores on standardized spatial ability tests. Users completed game play in between pre-test and post-test evaluation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>Visuospatial Characterization and Analysis of Spatial Abilities of Video Game Players</b> | PhD dissertation<br /> Addressed the taxonomy associated with games used in spatial ability research as well as the connection between game play experience and spatial test performance across groups of players by dominant genre. Self-reported participant data were used to classify games by inherent visuospatial characteristics. These characteristics were then used to cluster users with preferred gameplay. Clusters were then compared to determine differences, if any, across three measures of spatial ability.</p>

    <div id="home" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      	<p>Adam and I studied together at Purdue University in the then-nascent field of virtual reality. Adam was consistently out in front on the vision side of things, able to conceptualize applications for our technology that were not only interesting but useful. He has that rare combination of energetic creativity coupled with rigorous technical skills. During our studies he was as comfortable working through difficult statistical proofs as he was sketching animated characters for a game. Further, his background in the life sciences provides him a researcher's eye for logic, critical thinking, and managing complex, interacting systems. He is also a tireless collaborator, willing to put in the hours required to make a difficult project successful. Lastly, he is friendly, funny, and personable - an outstanding team member who is a pleasure to work with.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
	<p>I had the pleasure of working with Adam for just over two years at Florida State University's Learning Systems Institute. During that time, Adam served as a producer for the documentary series Perspectives, and acted as content coordinator for over 60 short films ranging in topics from aeronautics, marine biology, chemistry, ecology in the Kenyan savannah, and even candy making to name a few. In total, Adam served as content lead for over 300 short films in the Perspectives series.</p>
	<p>Adam took great pride in his work with the film series. Every project was met with an enthusiasm to create the best possible learning experience for the user. He also recognized the importance of production quality, and actively sought projects that pushed the creative limits of the production team.</p>      
	<p>Adam's greatest strength is his ability to work with others. He carries an enthusiasm for his work that's contagious and improves the work (and attitudes) of those around him. I never had a disagreement with Adam during the two years that we worked closely together. He has a great way of making those around him feel valued and appreciated for their contribution to the effort. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      	<p>I have been impressed with his commitment to excellence. In every activity he undertook, Adam ensured he understood his role and how what he did fit into the goal of the program and in the organization. His work ethic was recognized and much admired by all of his colleagues.</p>
	<p>I cannot write a reference for Adam without mention of one of his passions - personal development linked with commitment to successful outcomes for himself and those with whom he worked. He can be defined as one who is perpetually striving to improve performance. I have had many discussions with him and have found him well informed and current in his discipline/interests. He formulates his opinions based on information gathered from researching a topic. He is thorough.</p>
	<p>It is my belief that you can be assured that he will be as highly committed, work well with others, will be engaged immediately in enabling any team to pursue continuing excellence for future advancement. I recommend Adam, without any reservation.</p>
