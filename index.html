  </p>
<br/>
<p><em>Personal Statement</em></p>	
<p style="text-align:left">What sets me apart from most people I have had the opportunity to meet is my interdisciplinary background and interest in fusing STEAM disciplines for education. My lifelong interest in science took me into the molecular biology lab, my desire for creative expression took me into the ceramics lab, and my interest in technology and visual media took me into the computer lab. I think this breadth and depth of experience at the intersection of science, media, and technology shapes the way I approach problem solving and education in a positive, beneficial way that I wouldn't have had I not been involved in these different areas.</p> 

<p style="text-align:left">What shifted my thinking from science to STEAM was exposure to coursework that I thought would be much better served through animation and visual experiences versus academic reporting. With the permission of a course professor, I submitted an assignment as a media file instead of the requested paper and received excellent feedback from fellow students and the instructor on finding a method for creatively addressing a tangled biochemical pathway we were to explore in class. In addition, I was encouraged to get involved in a national outreach program at NASA Kennedy Space Center and ended up working for a summer with undergraduate students in the Life Science Laboratory there. This further spurred my interest in outreach and education.</p>  

<p style="text-align:left">In graduate school I worked as a teaching assistant for a variety of biology and botany courses while completing requirements for my PhD in technology. I had some opportunities to hone my instructional skills and was awarded a Fellowship from the National Science Foundation GK-12 program to bring my expertise to a middle school science and mathematics classroom. In that role I worked with a teacher to develop and publish a lesson on social networks and a simulated virus transmission among the student population.</p> 

<p style="text-align:left">After school I worked in a role that provided myriad opportunities for growth and creative curriculum development. As part of that team I helped launch and develop K-12 STEAM programs related to video production, 3D-printing, and interactive tutorials. I was deeply involved in teacher professional development and led a series of workshops where I was able to implement novel instruction for teachers to learn to use statistical analysis software in their classrooms. My goals were to increase teacher effectiveness and to create highly-engaging media for both formal and informal educational experiences.</p> 

<p style="text-align:left">Perhaps the most important trait I offer is that of collaboration. I previously built a collaborative network from the ground up to enable our group to produce a large library of video content which relied on partnerships from local, municipal, state, and national partners. I'm confident in saying I played a very important role in establishing, fostering, and leveraging those connections to allow us to produce content to help teachers. What I gained from that experience is a deep interest in bridging fields across STEM disciplines and helping educators through those connections.</p> 

<p style="text-align:left">My future interests lie in continuing to find opportunities at the crossroads of science, technology, education, and visual media to promote learning in traditional and non-traditional environments. I'm especially interested in the future of computational thinking in the classroom and applications for data science and visualization within K-12 schools.</p>

<h3>Related Research</h3>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>Biosensor-controlled Interactive Environments for Virtual Reality</b> | PhD coursework<br /> Collaborated on an interactive and immersive VR environment involving user biofeedback to control a helicopter in an outdoor scene. My colleague created the hardware interface while I created the models, environment, and interactions. A stretch sensor worn around the abdomen allowed the user to drive several inputs for environmental lighting, helicopter altitude, and on-craft lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>Evaluation of Dead-reckoning Ability in Immersive Virtual Environments</b> | PhD coursework<br /> Collaborated on a simple VR testing environment and corresponding research program to evaluate users' ability to determine distances and positions in a flat scene with several levels of navigational cues. Users were scored on their ability to travel in a prescribed manner using temporary targets and to then return to the origin.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>Influence of Interactive Spatial Problem Solving on Spatial Test Performance</b> | PhD coursework<br /> Developed a pilot test to examine the ability of interactive spatial problem solving within game play to influence user scores on standardized spatial ability tests. Users completed game play in between pre-test and post-test evaluation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><b>Visuospatial Characterization and Analysis of Spatial Abilities of Video Game Players</b> | PhD dissertation<br /> Addressed the taxonomy associated with games used in spatial ability research as well as the connection between game play experience and spatial test performance across groups of players by dominant genre. Self-reported participant data were used to classify games by inherent visuospatial characteristics. These characteristics were then used to cluster users with preferred gameplay. Clusters were then compared to determine differences, if any, across three measures of spatial ability.</p>

      	<p>David Whittinghill, PhD | Purdue University</p>
	<p>Adam and I studied together at Purdue University in the then-nascent field of virtual reality. Adam was consistently out in front on the vision side of things, able to conceptualize applications for our technology that were not only interesting but useful. He has that rare combination of energetic creativity coupled with rigorous technical skills. During our studies he was as comfortable working through difficult statistical proofs as he was sketching animated characters for a game. Further, his background in the life sciences provides him a researcher's eye for logic, critical thinking, and managing complex, interacting systems. He is also a tireless collaborator, willing to put in the hours required to make a difficult project successful. Lastly, he is friendly, funny, and personable - an outstanding team member who is a pleasure to work with.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
	<p>Bud Simpson | Independent Filmmaker</p>
	<p>I had the pleasure of working with Adam for just over two years at Florida State University's Learning Systems Institute. During that time, Adam served as a producer for the documentary series Perspectives, and acted as content coordinator for over 60 short films ranging in topics from aeronautics, marine biology, chemistry, ecology in the Kenyan savannah, and even candy making to name a few. In total, Adam served as content lead for over 300 short films in the Perspectives series.</p>
	<p>Adam took great pride in his work with the film series. Every project was met with an enthusiasm to create the best possible learning experience for the user. He also recognized the importance of production quality, and actively sought projects that pushed the creative limits of the production team.</p>      
	<p>Adam's greatest strength is his ability to work with others. He carries an enthusiasm for his work that's contagious and improves the work (and attitudes) of those around him. I never had a disagreement with Adam during the two years that we worked closely together. He has a great way of making those around him feel valued and appreciated for their contribution to the effort. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      	<p>Audrey Trotman, PhD | NOAA</p>
	<p>I have been impressed with his commitment to excellence. In every activity he undertook, Adam ensured he understood his role and how what he did fit into the goal of the program and in the organization. His work ethic was recognized and much admired by all of his colleagues.</p>
	<p>I cannot write a reference for Adam without mention of one of his passions - personal development linked with commitment to successful outcomes for himself and those with whom he worked. He can be defined as one who is perpetually striving to improve performance. I have had many discussions with him and have found him well informed and current in his discipline/interests. He formulates his opinions based on information gathered from researching a topic. He is thorough.</p>
	<p>It is my belief that you can be assured that he will be as highly committed, work well with others, will be engaged immediately in enabling any team to pursue continuing excellence for future advancement. I recommend Adam, without any reservation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
	    <p>Ronald L. Carr, PhD | Florida State College, Jacksonville</p>
	    <p>I have had the pleasure of knowing Adam for several years and was able to work with him while I was at FSU for over two years. His breadth and depth of knowledge are quite impressive and difficult to describe in a concise manner. However, I would say his curiosity and desire to learn are two of his greatest traits. Together, those add up to a perfect person to collaborate with in both research and design. He has many great ideas and the skills to do something with them. </p>
	    <p>We collaborated on several projects for The Florida Center for Research in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (FCR–STEM), ranging from the design of curriculum for students to development and delivery of teacher professional development, research, publication, and adapting and merging instructional theories and models. The most notable, in my opinion, was our work on combining the engineering-mathematical problems known as Model-Eliciting Activities with the use and instruction of 3D-printed models; together, called 3D+MEAs. Adam led a 3D+MEA curriculum writing retreat with over 50 experts from math, science, and education. He also initiated a partnership with NASA's Kennedy Space Center that led to our design, development, implementation, and evaluation of week-long teacher professional development/curriculum design workshops at NASA for highly-qualified Florida K-12 teachers and NASA Education personnel. While most found the task of designing the 3D+MEA curriculum to be difficult (because it is), participants and staff reported the experience to be valuable and profoundly memorable. This project was a spin-off of another successful project that Adam solely created and developed for the use of 3D-printed manipulatives and accompanying curriculum for K-12 science classrooms.</p>
	    <p>Beyond the 3D+MEA and 3D STEM Kits projects, Adam served as a subject matter expert and curriculum designer for interactive, online learning modules for K-12 students. As a member of the instructional design team, I recall our ID team always fighting to get to work on Adam's modules because he combined his expertise in science and graphic design with advanced instructional design skills to provide the best science content that we had.</p>

	    <p>It was an incredible honor to work with Adam for over 5 years at the Learning Systems Institute at Florida State University. He always impressed with a deep knowledge of biological and ecological systems, UX, human-computer interactions, and graphic design. If he wasn't already an expert on a subject, he always become one in short order.</p>
	    <p>His creativity and broad skillset set him apart as a professional who always made novel and meaningful contributions to every discussion and project. Adam saw possibilities for integrating technologies and systems to improve our projects before most team members had fully grasped the scope of the original task. Because of our mission, he continuously enhanced his expertise in teacher professional development, instructional design, project management, video production, eLearning development, and the development of other learning tools for students and teachers. His growth in these areas impressed me most because he didn't have a background as a classroom teacher before joining our team.</p> 
            <p>Adam's fantastic attitude made him a integral part of our office culture. He always focused on building positive relationships, personal growth, increasing efficiency in our processes, and improving the culture and functioning of our team. He accepted feedback graciously, applied it to all future products, and provided meaningful feedback to me as a colleague and to other members of the team. He was unflappable when faced with challenges and had an uncanny knack for turning them into opportunities.</p>

<p style="text-align:left"><b>Soybean Growth Response to Touch</b> | Horticulture Research<br /> 
This video was recorded in a vibration-free darkroom illuminated by special green lighting designed to not stimulate growth. 
	A watch was placed to aid in time measurement. As the seedlings emerge, they lengthen through expansion of cells in the 
	hypocotyl elongation zone at a similar rate. At the time of touch, 
	noted by the removal on an extra seedling in the front, one seedling 
	(this one got poked) slows to a halt, while the other continues to elongate. 
	Bonus: you can see the seedlings exhibiting nutation (bending back and forth) 
	as they elongate in this time-lapse video. <br />
