###Overview
Interdisciplinary researcher/developer with experience in quantitative and qualitative research for interactive 3D computer graphics, human spatial ability, data        visualization, virtual and augmented reality, serious games, 3D modeling and printing, documentary-style video production and direction, statistical analysis, and K-12 STEM outreach for teacher professional development. Experience connecting people at local, municipal, state, and federal levels to ensure project success. Extensive background in life sciences including plant physiology and molecular biology with associated laboratory techniques. Career interests include human-computer interactions and interfaces, applications of human spatial ability research to gaming and immersive educational experiences, data science and data-driven decision making, advanced data perception methodologies, technology integration for K-12 education, life science outreach, and public informal STEM education.

###Recent Experience
Most recently, I worked at the Learning Systems Institute at Florida State University for 5+ years in research and development related to K-12 STEM teacher professional development. In this really interesting position, I studied and implemented novel methods for curriculum development and teacher professional development. Along the way, I developed educational standards maps, over 350 short-format documentaries, many 3D-printable models and associated lesson plans, over 40 interactive student tutorials, and many statistics training modules for science teachers (see code tab). 

Before that, I served as a Fellow for the National Science Foundation Graduate Students in K-12 Education (GK-12) Program. I partnered with an 8th-grade teacher and we collaborated to bring data visualization lessons to middle school students. We eventually published my lesson on creating and studying the social network generated from a simulated virus spreading through the population. 

Another great experience I had was as a Project Counselor with the NASA Spaceflight and Life Sciences Training Program (SLSTP), administered by Tuskeegee University and hosted at the Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Along with two other PCs, I mentored a group of undergraduate students over six weeks as they got first-hand research experience with NASA experts.
