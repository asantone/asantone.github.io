<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Adam and I studied together at Purdue University in the then-nascent field of virtual reality. Adam was consistently out in front on the vision side of things, able to conceptualize applications for our technology that were not only interesting but useful. He has that rare combination of energetic creativity coupled with rigorous technical skills. During our studies he was as comfortable working through difficult statistical proofs as he was sketching animated characters for a game. Further, his background in the life sciences provides him a researcher’s eye for logic, critical thinking, and managing complex, interacting systems. He is also a tireless collaborator, willing to put in the hours required to make a difficult project successful. Lastly, he is friendly, funny, and personable - an outstanding team member who is a pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>Adam and I were colleagues in graduate school, often completing coursework and associated research projects at the Purdue Envision Center for Data Perceptualization. One of our collaborative research projects involved constructing a study to evaluate user navigation performance in an immersive virtual environment. Adam primarily worked on the environment and interaction, while I worked on user recruitment and data collection procedures. Adam was great at setting up the environment, navigation, and system for creating in-scene visual cues. He’s a great guy to work with and I’d recommend him for any VR user research team.</p>

<p>I have always admired Adam’s ability to deal with ambiguity and lack of direction with patience and initiative. He required little to no supervision and was always full of positive and creative ideas during our brainstorming sessions. His broad knowledge in a variety of disciplines allowed him to provide valuable insights on our multi-disciplinary projects. I will also vouch for his creativity and artistic abilities when it comes to creating user interfaces and graphic designs.</p>

<p><em>Program Coordinator, Learning Systems Institute, Florida State University</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I had the pleasure of working with Adam for just over two years at Florida State University’s Learning Systems Institute. During that time, Adam served as a producer for the documentary series Perspectives, and acted as content coordinator for over 60 short films ranging in topics from aeronautics, marine biology, chemistry, ecology in the Kenyan savannah, and even candy making to name a few. In total, Adam served as content lead for over 300 short films in the Perspectives series.</p>
<p>Adam took great pride in his work with the film series. Every project was met with an enthusiasm to create the best possible learning experience for the user. He also recognized the importance of production quality, and actively sought projects that pushed the creative limits of the production team.</p>
<p>Adam’s greatest strength is his ability to work with others. He carries an enthusiasm for his work that’s contagious and improves the work (and attitudes) of those around him. I never had a disagreement with Adam during the two years that we worked closely together. He has a great way of making those around him feel valued and appreciated for their contribution to the effort.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It was an incredible honor to work with Adam for over 5 years at the Learning Systems Institute at Florida State University. He always impressed with a deep knowledge of biological and ecological systems, UX, human-computer interactions, and graphic design. If he wasn’t already an expert on a subject, he always become one in short order.</p>
<p>His creativity and broad skillset set him apart as a professional who always made novel and meaningful contributions to every discussion and project. Adam saw possibilities for integrating technologies and systems to improve our projects before most team members had fully grasped the scope of the original task. Because of our mission, he continuously enhanced his expertise in teacher professional development, instructional design, project management, video production, eLearning development, and the development of other learning tools for students and teachers. His growth in these areas impressed me most because he didn’t have a background as a classroom teacher before joining our team.</p>
<p>Adam’s fantastic attitude made him a integral part of our office culture. He always focused on building positive relationships, personal growth, increasing efficiency in our processes, and improving the culture and functioning of our team. He accepted feedback graciously, applied it to all future products, and provided meaningful feedback to me as a colleague and to other members of the team. He was unflappable when faced with challenges and had an uncanny knack for turning them into opportunities.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have had the pleasure of knowing Adam for several years and was able to work with him while I was at FSU for over two years. His breadth and depth of knowledge are quite impressive and difficult to describe in a concise manner. However, I would say his curiosity and desire to learn are two of his greatest traits. Together, those add up to a perfect person to collaborate with in both research and design. He has many great ideas and the skills to do something with them.</p>
<p>We collaborated on several projects for The Florida Center for Research in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (FCR–STEM), ranging from the design of curriculum for students to development and delivery of teacher professional development, research, publication, and adapting and merging instructional theories and models. The most notable, in my opinion, was our work on combining the engineering-mathematical problems known as Model-Eliciting Activities with the use and instruction of 3D-printed models; together, called 3D+MEAs. Adam led a 3D+MEA curriculum writing retreat with over 50 experts from math, science, and education. He also initiated a partnership with NASA’s Kennedy Space Center that led to our design, development, implementation, and evaluation of week-long teacher professional development/curriculum design workshops at NASA for highly-qualified Florida K-12 teachers and NASA Education personnel. While most found the task of designing the 3D+MEA curriculum to be difficult (because it is), participants and staff reported the experience to be valuable and profoundly memorable. This project was a spin-off of another successful project that Adam solely created and developed for the use of 3D-printed manipulatives and accompanying curriculum for K-12 science classrooms.</p>
<p>Beyond the 3D+MEA and 3D STEM Kits projects, Adam served as a subject matter expert and curriculum designer for interactive, online learning modules for K-12 students. As a member of the instructional design team, I recall our ID team always fighting to get to work on Adam’s modules because he combined his expertise in science and graphic design with advanced instructional design skills to provide the best science content that we had.</p>

<p>I have been impressed with his commitment to excellence. In every activity he undertook, Adam ensured he understood his role and how what he did fit into the goal of the program and in the organization. His work ethic was recognized and much admired by all of his colleagues.</p>
<p>I cannot write a reference for Adam without mention of one of his passions - personal development linked with commitment to successful outcomes for himself and those with whom he worked. He can be defined as one who is perpetually striving to improve performance. I have had many discussions with him and have found him well informed and current in his discipline/interests. He formulates his opinions based on information gathered from researching a topic. He is thorough.</p>
<p>It is my belief that you can be assured that he will be as highly committed, work well with others, will be engaged immediately in enabling any team to pursue continuing excellence for future advancement. I recommend Adam, without any reservation.</p>
