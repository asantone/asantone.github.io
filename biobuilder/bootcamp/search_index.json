Desired Educational Outcomes It is important to know where you are planning to go so here are a few targeted educational outcomes we will be attempting to address during this program. These standards are simply statements about what a student is expected to do and are listed among the ‘computational thinking competencies’ described by ISTE. Computational standards from ISTE: (1b) Learn to recognize where and how computation can be used to enrich data or content to solve discipline-specific problems and be able to connect these opportunities to foundational CT practices and CS concepts. (2e) Communicate with students, parents and leaders about the impacts of computing in our world and across diverse roles and professional life, and why these skills are essential for all students. (3a) Model and learn with students how to formulate computational solutions to problems and how to give and receive actionable feedback. (4a) Design CT activities where data can be obtained, analyzed and represented to support problem-solving and learning in other content areas. (5c) Use a variety of instructional approaches to help students frame problems in ways that can be represented as computational steps or algorithms to be performed by a computer. Functional Educational Outcomes Be able to: improve your ability to communicate scientific information import and analyze large datasets use principles of design in your visualizations implement analysis and plotting in R and RStudio write with R Markdown and combine text and graphics integrate data analysis and visualization into your research project workflow About the Structure The Computational Thinking portion of this program is divided into four seminars and two discussions about current topics. The seminars are split into a ‘thinking part’ and a ‘doing part’. You might think of it as abstract plus concrete or ‘minds on’ and ‘hands on’. Computational Tools For this portion of the program, we will use the programming language R and the most common integrated development environment called RStudio. Specifically, you will most likely use RStudio Cloud which is hosted online, but you also may use RStudio Desktop if you choose to install that software.

["seminar-i-principles-of-design.html", "Seminar I: Principles of Design Design for Scientific Communication Introduction to R and RStudio (Cloud)", " Seminar I: Principles of Design Design for Scientific Communication Introduction Effective scientific communication requires attention to accuracy along with consideration for a simple message in what could otherwise be complicated content. In this module, we will explore some principles of design philosophy that may be useful to you as students and professionals. This list is not exhaustive and is intended as a starting point. At the end of this module, you should be capable of creating and explaining improved plots that are more-accurate, well-formatted charts designed to visualize biological data. Data The data sets used in this module include: Global Shark Attacks Social network of bottlenose dolphins Tree Species Range Maps Topographic Information on Auckland’s Maunga Whau Volcano Drosophila Melanogaster Genome # Load useful libraries library(igraph) #for network data library(networkD3) #for network data / interactives library(tibble) #for data organization library(plyr) # data tools library(tidyverse) # a collection of data organization and visualization tools library(dplyr) # used to wrangle data library(ggplot2) # plotting with the &#39;grammar of graphics&#39; library(lubridate) # makes date data easier to work with library(readr) # helps with time information library(stringr) # helps with strings (text) library(viridisLite) #color palettes library(knitr) # for tables #read in the original data sets gsaf5&lt;-read_csv(&quot;data/global-shark-attacks/GSAF5.csv&quot;) flyData&lt;-read_csv(&quot;data/drosophila/genes-genscan.csv&quot;) lsData&lt;-read_csv(&quot;data/unitedNations/lifespan.csv&quot;) #save the data as some other name so you can retain the original safely #we will use names that are easy to remember and type attacks&lt;-as_tibble(gsaf5) fly&lt;-as_tibble(flyData) ls&lt;-as_tibble(lsData) #take a look at the first few rows #head(attacks, n=3) #head(seizures, n=3) Marks The ‘marks’ of a visualization are the main components independent of any decoration or placement. Points Lines Areas Points Let’s take a look at a simple example using the ‘ggplot2’ library and points. Lines Lines are another type of mark. What do the points and lines in this visualization of dolphins’ frequent associations represent? Areas If points are 0-dimensional, and lines are 1-dimensional, then areas are 2-dimensional. We won’t cover it here, but volumes are the next step with a 3-dimensional appearance. They have more limited use in data visualization, but do play a role. Areas represent two dimensions of data. Here we see the United States distribution of the tree species Sassafras albidum as an area plotted on a map. We use the ‘leaflet’ library to display the map and the ‘rgdal’ library to read in the shapefile data. This type of information is common in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research. Channels Position x,y coordinate represents: magnitude Size relative scale represents: magnitude Shape data point style represents: category Value greyscale value represents: magnitude Color hue represents: category, magnitude Position Position is a very strong channel and is used frequently to indicate differences in data. Here we see the magnitude along the X axis represent the year while the magnitude along the Y axis represents time of day. The position of each data point indicates the year and time of day of the recorded incident. Size Size can be incorporated into a plot to indicate an additional variable. Here we see the magnitude along the X axis represent the year while the magnitude along the Y axis represents time of day. A third variable, age of the victim, is represented by the size of the data point. The alpha channel, or transparency, of the data point has been reduced from 1 to 0.1 to improve visibility. Do you think this is a good way to represent the data in this case? Why or why not? Color Color is often used to represent categorical data such as groups, countries, and regions. Color also can be effectively used to represent magnitude quite well. Eye-catching color is a good way to represent groups but requires some attention due to the prevalence of color-blindness and the ability of too many colors muddying the visual waters. Color is most effective when its use is limited and contrast is maximized to highlight the underlying message of the visualization. Color to Highlight In this plot, color is used to highlight a specific age range for individuals over age 65. This would be useful if you are interested in telling a story about elderly victims or were interested in exploring trends for this particular age group. It is much easier for the viewer to see your intentions when highlighting is used effectively versus expecting the viewer to visually separate the data points to find your message. Pop-Quiz! Do you have any ideas why there are no reported attacks for the over-65 group before the mid-1980s? Color for Magnitude A quick note on gradients and color choice: consider carefully what your color is intended to convey. Do you have sequential data that are intended to suggest a linear effect? Do you have diverging data that suggest a ‘left’ and a ‘right’ side to a midpoint? Do you have qualitative data that represent categories? Using a poorly-chosen palette for these types of information can be misleading or confusing. Here is an example using a commonly-misused rainbow palette. Ask youself: what do these colors mean to the viewer? what is the meaning of green in this example? How far away from red is the blue? Does red imply higher or lower altitude than pink? Why is pink not next to red? Here we see a diverging color palette. Does this help? It could be better because it looks like the blue area is perhaps not important. Again, what does the white area signify here? Now consider the use of a gradient that work a little more clearly with terrain data. This color palette is inteded to mimic actual terrain which helps the viewer to make sense of the data intuitively. The result is improved but still a bit confusing perhaps. The green could be the ground, but what does the intense yellow mean? These data represent positional data and height for a volcano. From the dataset description: “Maunga Whau (Mt Eden) is one of about 50 volcanos in the Auckland volcanic field. This data set gives topographic information for Maunga Whau on a 10m by 10m grid.” Hexadecimal Colors Color is most easily represented as, well, a color. Because computers need to have instructions written as text, we must use other representations when programming. In R code, you may see the color red (isn’t that a bit subjective?) written as ‘red’, ‘rgb(1,0,0)’, or ‘#FF0000’. You probably recognize that first one, but the other two use the red-green-blue and hexadecimal notation. These methods are usually interchangable without too much trouble, but I find the hexadecimal notation to be more broadly useful for web development and other needs. What is hexadecimal notation and what does it have to do with color? Very briefly, representing color as a hexadecimal form allows computers to store information more effectively. The values for each digit go from 0 to F, that is: 0-9 and then A,B,C,D,E,F. “FF” is equivalent to 255 and 1 in the other systems. So, FFFFFF is white and 000000 is black. Web Tools for Color You can search “color chooser” in the Google Browser to find this tool, but you can also select from many other online tools to find a hexadecimal code. Fonts Keep it simple. Remember your audience and the setting of your presentation. I like sans-serif fonts because they are cleaner. Prioritize legible text for whatever medium you are using. Presentation in a room? Make the text larger. Poster? Make the main text larger. Computer display? Smaller is usually okay as the audience will be ‘seated’ closely. If you are unsure, make the text a little larger than usual. The Story Start with a message in mind and edit to ensure you are delivering that message. Show your data visualization to a friend or two to hear their interpretation of your intended message. Use the title and caption to clarify if the message is a bit complicated (and there is nothing wrong with that). Simplify if you can: remove extraneous colors, backgrounds, decoration, line weight, and other distracting details. Move the legend into a position that doesn’t distract. Follow principles for accurate representation of the data. Tufte’s Principles A compact reading of Tufte in three points: Prioritize the data Maximize the data-ink ratio Eliminate chart junk Real-world example! We have access to the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) genome and we would like to determine, from a predicted gene dataset, the approximate frequency of genes that contain three to four exons (coding regions). We will use a .csv file from the Drosophila data. These particular data were generated using AUGUSTUS software to predict genes from the genome sequence. Specifically, we will examine the ‘genes-genscan.csv’ file and observe the ‘exonCount’ column. Essentially, we will be plotting the exon count frequency for the fruit fly genome as predicted by AUGUSTUS. To do this, we will use a histogram which groups count values into ranges such as 0-5, 6-10, etc. Histograms are not bar charts and typically display the bars together. The bars touch with no gaps in between representing a continuous series of values along the x axis. Excel Histogram Here’s a chart to start. This one (cropped) is the default histogram created in MS Excel and the only change was to the title. What problems do you see with this chart? What actions would you take to improve it? R Histogram Let’s make some changes! First let’s recreate the histogram with R and the ggplot2 library. ggplot(fly, aes(x=exonCount)) + geom_histogram() Let’s add labels and a caption for our data source. ggplot(fly, aes(x=exonCount)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = &quot;Predicted Genome Exon Frequency&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Species: Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, x=&quot;Count&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, caption=&quot;Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome&quot;) If you think the ‘bins’ on the x axis are not quite to your liking, you can adjust them easily with ‘binwidth’. We’ll set the binwidth to 2. ggplot(fly, aes(x=exonCount)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) + labs(title = &quot;Predicted Genome Exon Frequency&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Species: Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, x=&quot;Count&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, caption=&quot;Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome&quot;) Let’s adjust the scales on the axes. This way we can see values more clearly and adjust the spacing to our preferred setting. ggplot(fly, aes(x=exonCount)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) + labs(title = &quot;Predicted Genome Exon Frequency&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Species: Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, x=&quot;Count&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, caption=&quot;Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome&quot;)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2,60,2))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10000,1000)) We can make this look a lot better by diminishing the background and adding a pop of color. ggplot(fly, aes(x=exonCount)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill=&quot;#03a5fc&quot;, color=&quot;#00517d&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Predicted Genome Exon Frequency&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Species: Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, x=&quot;Count&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, caption=&quot;Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome&quot;)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2,60,2))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10000,1000))+ theme_minimal() We can add a highlight to call attention to the frequency in the second bar (assuming this is important to the story). We can also increase font size and tweak the axes just a bit to limit the size of the unused white space. custom &lt;- c(rep(&quot;#eeeeee&quot;,1), rep(&quot;#03a5fc&quot;,1), rep(&quot;#eeeeee&quot;,35)) ggplot(fly, aes(x=exonCount)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill=custom, color=&quot;#cccccc&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Predicted Genome Exon Frequency&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Species: Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, x=&quot;Count&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, caption=&quot;Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome&quot;)+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2,60,2))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,9000,1000))+ coord_cartesian(xlim=c(2,60), ylim=c(0,9000))+ theme_minimal()+ theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 25), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15), axis.title = element_text(size = 20), axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)) Further Reading Additional information is available in the works of many authors who focus on the field of information design, but you may do well to begin with an exploration of the following: Jacques Bertin Semiologie Graphique (Semiology of Graphics) Edward Tufte Visual Display of Quantitative Information Envisioning Information Visual Explanations Beautiful Evidence Scott McCloud Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art not info viz specifically!

["seminar-ii-data-visualization.html", "Seminar II: Data Visualization Thinking about Data Hands-on Plotting", " Seminar II: Data Visualization Thinking about Data Let’s start by thinking about the following: What are data? How do we communicate our data to an audience? What audience cares about our data? What is a plot? What types of plots are there? What kinds of data are appropriate for which plots? Organizing your data In order to do effective research, you’ll need to organize any data such as observations, notes, quantitative values, and measurements. For numeric values, you will often use a table. For large sets of values, you will likely use a spreadsheet such as with Excel or Google Sheets. Simple data sets can be stored as a table. id date value 1 2020-07-01 0.335 2 2020-07-02 0.909 3 2020-07-03 0.412 4 2020-07-04 0.044 5 2020-07-05 0.764 6 2020-07-06 0.750 7 2020-07-07 0.800 8 2020-07-08 0.885 9 2020-07-09 0.449 10 2020-07-10 0.488 11 2020-07-11 0.946 12 2020-07-12 0.106 13 2020-07-13 0.383 14 2020-07-14 0.626 15 2020-07-15 0.578 16 2020-07-16 0.371 17 2020-07-17 0.893 18 2020-07-18 0.064 19 2020-07-19 0.236 20 2020-07-20 0.116 21 2020-07-21 0.473 22 2020-07-22 0.502 23 2020-07-23 0.635 24 2020-07-24 0.771 25 2020-07-25 0.104 26 2020-07-26 0.183 27 2020-07-27 0.873 28 2020-07-28 0.188 29 2020-07-29 0.111 30 2020-07-30 0.084 31 2020-07-31 0.942 32 2020-08-01 0.972 33 2020-08-02 0.529 34 2020-08-03 0.653 35 2020-08-04 0.120 36 2020-08-05 0.043 37 2020-08-06 0.056 38 2020-08-07 0.164 39 2020-08-08 0.227 40 2020-08-09 0.924 41 2020-08-10 0.686 42 2020-08-11 0.426 43 2020-08-12 0.499 44 2020-08-13 0.361 45 2020-08-14 0.496 46 2020-08-15 0.849 47 2020-08-16 0.724 48 2020-08-17 0.898 49 2020-08-18 0.460 50 2020-08-19 0.435 51 2020-08-20 0.406 52 2020-08-21 0.338 53 2020-08-22 0.519 54 2020-08-23 0.240 55 2020-08-24 0.617 56 2020-08-25 0.648 57 2020-08-26 0.202 58 2020-08-27 0.398 59 2020-08-28 0.085 60 2020-08-29 0.937 61 2020-08-30 0.556 62 2020-08-31 0.196 63 2020-09-01 0.746 64 2020-09-02 0.642 65 2020-09-03 0.871 66 2020-09-04 0.319 67 2020-09-05 0.317 68 2020-09-06 0.471 69 2020-09-07 0.803 70 2020-09-08 0.852 71 2020-09-09 0.226 72 2020-09-10 0.619 73 2020-09-11 0.430 74 2020-09-12 0.581 75 2020-09-13 0.774 76 2020-09-14 0.340 77 2020-09-15 0.594 78 2020-09-16 0.799 79 2020-09-17 0.898 80 2020-09-18 0.975 81 2020-09-19 0.442 82 2020-09-20 0.369 83 2020-09-21 0.882 84 2020-09-22 0.971 85 2020-09-23 0.662 86 2020-09-24 0.559 87 2020-09-25 0.220 88 2020-09-26 0.963 89 2020-09-27 0.763 90 2020-09-28 0.617 91 2020-09-29 0.540 92 2020-09-30 0.455 93 2020-10-01 0.850 94 2020-10-02 0.503 95 2020-10-03 0.800 96 2020-10-04 0.061 97 2020-10-05 0.536 98 2020-10-06 0.553 99 2020-10-07 0.508 100 2020-10-08 0.276 Histograms Useful for examining the shape of the distribution. These are NOT bar charts because they display frequency and not counts, means, or other values. Example: consider the set of values in the table. How many of those values are between 0 and 0.1? How many between 0.2 and 0.3? Are there relatively more large values or small values? Are the values distributed ‘normally’? A histogram will give us a clue. Scatterplot Used to evaluate the relationship between two variables. Each data point is a coordinate represented by one member of each variable. Example: Let’s examine the relationship between the ID of each data point and the value of each data point. Do you predict these might be related? If so, what would the plot look like? If not, what do you think the plot would look like? Bar chart Used to show the relationship of a numeric and categorical value such as totals, means, raw values, or similar quantities to allow for comparison. These often will have other decorations to help the viewer understand variability within the data set, such as ‘error bars’. Pie Chart Used ONLY to show percentage of a whole. Not recommended due to perception issues. Use a bar chart or a dot plot instead. Dot plot Displays frequency by category. Preferable to a pie chart. Line plot Used to display a trend of a continuous variable, such as height, relative to another continuous variable, such as time. If your data are not continuous, consider a bar chart or similar type of plot. The line suggests there are data in between observations so be careful with that assumption. Box plot Shows distribution and quartile information about a continuous data vector. Can be useful for comparing variables at a glance. Showing the data points provides additional useful information that can help viewers to interpret the data. Additional reading 3D plots Sometimes you need to show the relationship of three variables but this is somewhat rare. Excel and other programs offer options to ‘enhance’ your plots with shading, 3D effects, and other decorations that can be very distracting at best and misleading at worst. 3D plots are okay and even good if they are required to convey certain information, but 3D effects to entertain the viewer are not recommended. Do you recall the volcano data that showed height as color? This is a time when 3D is justified. We can’t really understand the difference in height with color very well. It helps, but what if we did color AND 3D? AND we make it interactive? Super helpful! Here is the 3D interactive version.

["seminar-iii-applied-visualization.html", "Seminar III: Applied Visualization An Opportunity in Agriculture Making Sense of Data", " Seminar III: Applied Visualization An Opportunity in Agriculture Problem Background Drosophila suzukii is a fruit fly species that is capable of infesting fruit during the ripening stage unlike its more familiar relatives that infest fruit typically only when fruits begin to decompose. Methyl benzoate is an organic compound with a pleasing aroma and is produced in some plants such as Antirrhinum majus commonly known as the snapdragon. In a paper titled “Developmental Regulation of Methyl Benzoate Biosynthesis and Emission in Snapdragon Flowers”, Natalia Dudareva of Purdue University describes the temporal and spatial aspects of how snapdragon flowers synthesize this scented compound from the precursor benzoic acid. In the paper titled \"A Floral Fragrance, Methyl Benzoate, is An Efficient Green Pesticide, Yan Feng &amp; Aijun Zhang describe how this compound may be useful in mitigating the effects of common crop pests such as Drosophila suzukii. All of this information leads to an idea: might we be able to use bioengineering methods to boost crop tolerance of pest species through the internal production of methyl benzoate? Activity What questions should we ask in order to prepare to design such a system? Promoter Strength Testing Assume we have constructed a bacterial system to produce methyl benzoate but we think the system could be optimized to produce a greater volume through the use of a carefully selected promoter. A team has designed a series of five promoters (pA, pB, pC, pD, pE) and has tested each with two different chassis (chassis 1 and 2) producing the dataset contained in promoters.csv. We will use the dataset to decide which promoters should be selected for use in additional in vivo trials with three commercial cultivars of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato): Trust, Blitz, and Match. Separation Chamber Testing Assume you have selected a single promoter pX to be used in live plant material and have successfully transformed plant tissues of all three cultivars to carry and express this construct. A separation chamber experiment has been designed and run to test the extent to which flies in each of the chambers (control,test) will die following exposure to fruit over a period of time. The treatment chamber contains fruit from a transformed apple which produces methyl benzoate in the fruit tissues. The data represent a count of fruit flies. Additional Testing What additional tests might be needed to more fully investigate this system? Making Sense of Data This activity has three parts: we’ll first examine and plot data from a promoter strength assessment and then we will compare results from a separation chamber experiment. Lastly, we will attempt to improve a box plot that describes the data from the separation chamber experiment. Please open RStudio Cloud and navigate to the materials for Seminar 3.

["seminar-iv-quantitative-analysis.html", "Seminar IV: Quantitative Analysis T-test and Regression Hands-on Analysis", " Seminar IV: Quantitative Analysis T-test and Regression T-tests A t-test is used to determine whether or not there is a statistically significant difference in two means. Certain assumptions are made for a t-test to be valid: Random samples - were the data collected as random samples that represent the larger population? Values are normally distributed - there is no indication the values are skewed in any way. (this is testable) Scores have the same variance – how far are the values spread from the average? Interpretation of results: Do you think that the means of these two groups are different? Yes, they are. Do you think they are ‘significantly’ different? To know that, we will need to do a t-test using the original data. group mean Group A 23.6 Group B 24.2 Your main focus in the results of the t-test is the p-value which represents “the probability of observing a sample statistic that is at least as extreme as your sample statistic when you assume that the null hypothesis is true.” Source Take home: If you get a high p-value (over 0.05 usually), your results are consistent with the null hypothesis and you can say you ‘do not reject the null hypothesis.’ If, however, your results give you a low p-value (&lt;0.05 typically), you should reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. These results indicate that there is an effect and a statistically significant difference in your observations. So, p &gt; 0.05, there is no difference; p &lt; 0.05, there is a difference. Consider the means above in the table. If the p-value from a t-test was 0.037, what would you conclude? Correlation This is a simple test to determine the extent to which two continuous variables are related. A value close to 1 suggests the relationship is approximately linear. A negative sign suggests that as one variable increases, the other decreases. Linear Regression This analysis generates a model that approximates your observed data. Essentially, you get a formula that can be used to predict values. There are other non-linear types of regression we will not cover. Be careful when modeling non-linear data! Sometimes scientists ‘correct’ non-linear data into a linear form to be able to model the data trend more easily. This is especially common with biological data. Interpretation of results: You will hear talk of independent and dependent variables. In linear regression, the p-value for each of your independent variables “tests the null hypothesis that the variable has no correlation with the dependent variable.” Source Example: You and your classmates study for an exam but you all study for different lengths of time. You find out that students that study more tend to get better grades. In this case your formula might look like GRADES = HOURS*X + k where k is some intercept. The variable HOURS is the independent variable and grades is the dependent variable. Your null hypothesis would state that ‘hours’ has no relationship with ‘grades’. If you get a low p-value, you would reject this idea and claim that the length of study time DOES have a relationship with student grades. The p-value in a regression works similarly to that in other tests but be careful how you interpret results. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = sy ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -41.563 -19.981 0.469 20.345 38.645 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

It is that study hours has no relationship with grades. What is the p-value for the independent variable ‘x’ (the study hours)? Can we reject the null hypothesis? What then can we conclude? Does this conclusion match up with the visual results we see in the plot? Hands-on Analysis This activity is set up for you to complete a t-test to compare means of two groups and to determine a function that can be used to predict data points using existing data values. Please open RStudio Cloud and navigate to the materials for Seminar 4. We will work through these activities together. "]
