<h1>Analysis of COVID-19 Data</h1>
<div id="scientific-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Scientific Questions</h2>
<p>When thinking about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated COVID-19 disease, many questions may come to mind. Among those, you may be wondering about the genetics of the virus: what similarities does its sequence share with other known viruses, how might the sequence influence tools that can be developed to combat its spread? You may wonder about the speed and spread of the disease: how rapidly does it spread in a population, how many total are infected, what is the recovery rate in infected individuals? Again, there are many ways to investigate but here we will do an analysis of the sequence and then investigate the timeline of infections.</p>
</div>
<div id="sequence-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Sequence Analysis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What would you like to measure regarding COVID-19?</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="gc-content" class="section level3">
<h3>GC Content</h3>
<p>One way to examine a DNA sequence is to look at the <a href="http://rosalind.info/glossary/gc-content/">GC-content</a> proportion of G and C bases relative to the entire sequence. To do this, a scientist would count all of the bases and find the fraction that are G or C. It sounds tedious so a computer program is ideal for this type of task! Let’s use R to calculate the G+C ratio for a sequence of DNA. We can just use the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to test this program. To do the analysis, we can load the Biostrings package into R and use some of the built-in functionality. Tools like Biostrings were written for cases just like this! We can do the basic analysis in a few lines of code. A few more lines of code are required to gather and organize the data for specific gene-encoding regions in the sequence.</p>
<p>Data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="data/sarscov2.fasta">FASTA</a> LC522972.1 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we can load the sequence data from a FASTA file.</p>

<li>what portion of the gene sequences have a gc ratio above 0.35?</li>

<blockquote>
<p>What would you do to improve this plot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an upgraded plot that is more appealing. The ratio for the full sequence is highlighted for comparison to the coding regions. This plot uses a library called ‘ggplot2’ to handle the graphics. <span class="citation">(Wickham <a href="#ref-citeGG" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> You’ll notice the style of this code uses ‘+’ symbols to add features. You can think of it like:</p>
<ul>
<li>[main graph] +</li>
<li>[draw some bars] +</li>
<li>[make it sideways] +</li>
<li>[add a title]+</li>
<li>[change the colors] +</li>
<li>[more cool stuff].</li>

It is a nucleocapsid phosphoprotein that helps to package the viral genome, among other functions.

<h3>Filtering Data</h3>
<p>We’re interested in examining the rise (and fall?) of infections in China, Italy, South Korea, and the United States from the first date through the most current date. Ideally, we will produce a line graph with a single line for each country. Problem: our dataset has more information than we need and we should filter it to a smaller set of information so 1) it’s easier for a human to see what’s happening and 2) it’s easier for the computer to process. Now, this is not a huge dataset, but it’s good practice to understand how to limit the scope of your data for analyses. This portion of data analysis is sometimes called ‘data wrangling’ because we need to ‘wrangle’ the data into good form before we work with it directly. It’s a great idea to separate your main data from the data you wrangled so you can always go back to the main file.</p>

<p>We have multiple values for each region due to the different sub-regions that were not retained in the data set. We’ll want to collapse these rows by each region. For example, there are several ‘US’ rows, each with their own timeline but we would like to simplify this to a single ‘US’ row.

<h3>Pivoting Data</h3>
<p>One more step we need to take is to transform our column headers that represent dates into actual date-type data and put the whole set of dates into a ‘long’ format. This will make more sense when you see the result but essentially the data for the dates is across-ways and we want it to go down-ways as actual data instead of a header value. Note that the ‘region’ values are repeated as necessary for each new row.</p>

<h3>Effective Communication</h3>
<p>What we produced before was a simple plot but let’s do a little better. Can we bring focus to the rate of change to see accelerating illness? This could perhaps highlight times where each region experienced an increased infection rate. To do this, we will need to add a new calculated column where each count is compared to the previous value.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Italy, South Korea, United States</h3>
<p>Reports indicate <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-south-korea-test-data/">massive and widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing in South Korea</a> with relatively little testing in Italy and the United States. How might this methodology impact the rate of infection in each population? Let’s take a look at those regions specifically.</p>
<p>“As of Wednesday (3/18/2020), South Korea had tested over 295,000 people for the coronavirus, reporting over 8,500 infections with 81 deaths.” - Grady McGregor, Fortune Magazine.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/us/coronavirus-testing-data.html">an article published by the New York Times</a>, the US and Italy have tested approximately 25,000 and 28,000 in a similar time frame, respectively.</p>
<p>Populations sizes are not the same so we can think of this in terms of density. That is, how many tests are each country performing per unit of population? Data indicate that the US is testing at a rate of around 100 tests per 1 million people. Italy is testing around 2,100 per million and South Korea is testing around 5,200 per million.</p>
<p>South Korea is effectively testing for the virus at a rate of approximately 25x that of Italy and 50X or more than that of the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are some possible implications in this disparity of testing rates?</p>

<h3>Something to remember</h3>
<p>Higher testing rates can result in a higher number of reported infections. It makes sense that if you are not looking, you will not find a result and if you look very carefully, you have a higher probability of finding that for which you are looking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might this change your view of the accuracy of infection rate data from the US versus Italy, South Korea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How might US data change if testing density increased from 100 per million to a more aggresive rate of 5,000 or more per million like South Korea?</p>

<h2>Spatial Data Visualization</h2>
<p>The spread of Sars-CoV-2 is a global event and you may be interested to think of this event in terms of geography. We can use the ‘leaflet’ library to display latitude and longitude data included in the data set. While this virus is spreading globally, we will focus on the United States for this visualization. Our primary questions will be where, when, and to what extent does this virus appear in the United States?</p>
<div id="leaflet-map" class="section level3">
<h3>Leaflet Map</h3>
<p>Here is an interactive map showing all of our data points. The point radius size represents the number of confirmed infections. One problem with this is that the map shows all points for all locations stacked on top of eachother and does not really represent the time aspect of the data set very well.</p>

<h3>Interactive Map</h3>
<p>To address the desire of having time and space represented simultaneously, it may be helpful to implement <a href="https://sandbox.shinyapps.io/confirmed/">an interactive map</a> where the user can control the view and the timeline through a slider control. This map was created using the library called ‘Shiny’ and the Leaflet library used before.</p>
