(public domain) Purpose This lecture will require students to engage in both computational and creative thinking to analyze and present data. Several elements that make data easy to understand and statistically meaningful will be reviewed. Students will have access to online R-suite tools for sequence analysis, allowing them to ask questions about how well the genomes from two viruses align to one another and how rapidly a virus can be detected in different locations. Intended Learner The learning modules are intended for middle and high school students who are interested in expanding their understanding of how information plays a critical role in communicating science concepts, how data analysis methods allow for increased confidence in conclusions, and how effective communication for a public audience can utilize a combination of images, text, and interactive media. Intended Learning Outcomes Students of this module will be able to: describe the purpose of data visualization identify an example of software used for quantitative analysis explain the reasons why ‘coding’ is useful for analysis and visualization describe and explain the purpose of a ‘notebook’ in the context of data science Education Standards Alignment Teachers are encouraged to consider incorporating portions of this content into their curriculum. This section of the ‘Bio-Engineering for a Changing World’ lecture series aligns broadly with the NGSS Science and Engineering Practice of Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking but specifically addresses content of the following: Middle School (6-8) Use digital tools (e.g., computers) to analyze very large data sets for patterns and trends. Use mathematical representations to describe and/or support scientific conclusions and design solutions. Create algorithms (a series of ordered steps) to solve a problem. Apply mathematical concepts and/or processes (such as ratio, rate, percent, basic operations, and simple algebra) to scientific and engineering questions and problems. High School (9-12) Create and/or revise a computational model or simulation of a phenomenon, designed device, process, or system. Use mathematical, computational, and/or algorithmic representations of phenomena or design solutions to describe and/or support claims and/or explanations. Apply techniques of algebra and functions to represent and solve scientific and engineering problems. The BioBuilder Educational Foundation BioBuilder, the organization supporting this program, is “an innovative, STEM education nonprofit created by an award-winning team at MIT …that… offers a wide range of open source, free curricula to provide hands-on experiences that foster exploration, innovation, and interest in the emerging area of synthetic biology.” Please visit BioBuilder.org to learn more!

["assignments.html", "Assignments", " Assignments Pre-lessons Day 1: Short Answer Please answer the following questions in the form of a short paragraph. What characteristics are shared by ‘good’ data visualizations? What skills are necessary for researchers to become good communicators? What tools do you typically use to create research reports and graphs and what are the strengths/weaknesses of those tools? Day 2: Hands-on Visualization Part 1 Please read the following background information on promoters. Briefly, promoters are short sequences of DNA that influence the transcription of downstream sequences. A highly effective strong promoter will lead to more proteins while a weak promoter will lead to less protein. Use the following information to create an appropriate plot to show promoter strength: A bioengineer designed a study to evaluate the average strength of six different promoter sequences used to initiate transcription of a DNA open reading frame that results in a colorful protein in transformed E. coli bacteria. The cells were labeled as six different strains depending on their promoter variant: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6. An additional variant P0 was used as a promoter-less control. Cells were uniformly subjected to standard protocols for protein expression and measurement. Protein levels from each strain were measured in Miller Units over three trials. The P5 sample in Trial 2 was accidentally destroyed resulting in a measurement of NA (not available). Note: Use your choice of software!

["design-philosophy-for-scientific-communication.html", "Design Philosophy for Scientific Communication", " Design Philosophy for Scientific Communication Introduction Effective scientific communication requires attention to accuracy along with consideration for a simple message in what could otherwise be complicated content. In this module, we will explore some principles of design philosophy that may be useful to you as students and professionals. This list is not exhaustive and is intended as a starting point. At the end of this module, you should be capable of creating and explaining improved plots that are more-accurate, well-formatted charts designed to visualize biological data. Data The data sets used in this module include: Global Shark Attacks Social network of bottlenose dolphins Tree Species Range Maps Topographic Information on Auckland’s Maunga Whau Volcano Drosophila Melanogaster Genome Marks The ‘marks’ of a visualization are the main components independent of any decoration or placement. Points Lines Areas Points Let’s take a look at a simple example using the ‘ggplot2’ library and points. Lines Lines are another type of mark. What do the points and lines in this visualization of dolphins’ frequent associations represent? Areas If points are 0-dimensional, and lines are 1-dimensional, then areas are 2-dimensional. We won’t cover it here, but volumes are the next step with a 3-dimensional appearance. They have more limited use in data visualization, but do play a role. Areas represent two dimensions of data. Here we see the United States distribution of the tree species Sassafras albidum as an area plotted on a map. We use the ‘leaflet’ library to display the map and the ‘rgdal’ library to read in the shapefile data. This type of information is common in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research. Channels Position x,y coordinate represents: magnitude Size relative scale represents: magnitude Shape data point style represents: category Value greyscale value represents: magnitude Color hue represents: category, magnitude Position Position is a very strong channel and is used frequently to indicate differences in data. Here we see the magnitude along the X axis represent the year while the magnitude along the Y axis represents time of day. The position of each data point indicates the year and time of day of the recorded incident. Size Size can be incorporated into a plot to indicate an additional variable. Here we see the magnitude along the X axis represent the year while the magnitude along the Y axis represents time of day. A third variable, age of the victim, is represented by the size of the data point. The alpha channel, or transparency, of the data point has been reduced from 1 to 0.1 to improve visibility. Do you think this is a good way to represent the data in this case? Why or why not? Color Color is often used to represent categorical data such as groups, countries, and regions. Color also can be effectively used to represent magnitude quite well. Eye-catching color is a good way to represent groups but requires some attention due to the prevalence of color-blindness and the ability of too many colors muddying the visual waters. Color is most effective when its use is limited and contrast is maximized to highlight the underlying message of the visualization. Color to Highlight In this plot, color is used to highlight a specific age range for individuals over age 65. This would be useful if you are interested in telling a story about elderly victims or were interested in exploring trends for this particular age group. It is much easier for the viewer to see your intentions when highlighting is used effectively versus expecting the viewer to visually separate the data points to find your message. Pop-Quiz! Do you have any ideas why there are no reported attacks for the over-65 group before the mid-1980s? Color for Magnitude These data represent positional data and height for a volcano. From the dataset description: “Maunga Whau (Mt Eden) is one of about 50 volcanos in the Auckland volcanic field. This data set gives topographic information for Maunga Whau on a 10m by 10m grid.” Hexadecimal Colors Color is most easily represented as, well, a color. Because computers need to have instructions written as text, we must use other representations when programming. In R code, you may see the color red (isn’t that a bit subjective?) written as ‘red’, ‘rgb(1,0,0)’, or ‘#FF0000’. You probably recognize that first one, but the other two use the red-green-blue and hexadecimal notation. These methods are usually interchangable without too much trouble, but I find the hexadecimal notation to be more broadly useful for web development and other needs. What is hexadecimal notation and what does it have to do with color? Very briefly, representing color as a hexadecimal form allows computers to store information more effectively. The values for each digit go from 0 to F, that is: 0-9 and then A,B,C,D,E,F. “FF” is equivalent to 255 and 1 in the other systems. So, FFFFFF is white and 000000 is black. Web Tools for Color You can search “color chooser” in the Google Browser to find this tool, but you can also select from many other online tools to find a hexadecimal code. Fonts Keep it simple. Remember your audience and the setting of your presentation. I like sans-serif fonts because they are cleaner. Prioritize legible text for whatever medium you are using. Presentation in a room? Make the text larger. Poster? Make the main text larger. Computer display? Smaller is usually okay as the audience will be ‘seated’ closely. If you are unsure, make the text a little larger than usual. The Story Start with a message in mind and edit to ensure you are delivering that message. Show your data visualization to a friend or two to hear their interpretation of your intended message. Use the title and caption to clarify if the message is a bit complicated (and there is nothing wrong with that). Simplify if you can: remove extraneous colors, backgrounds, decoration, line weight, and other distracting details. Move the legend into a position that doesn’t distract. Follow principles for accurate representation of the data. Tufte’s Principles A compact reading of Tufte in three points: Prioritize the data Maximize the data-ink ratio Eliminate chart junk Real-world example! We have access to the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) genome and we would like to determine, from a predicted gene dataset, the approximate frequency of genes that contain three to four exons (coding regions). We will use a .csv file from the Drosophila data. These particular data were generated using AUGUSTUS software to predict genes from the genome sequence. Specifically, we will examine the ‘genes-genscan.csv’ file and observe the ‘exonCount’ column. Essentially, we will be plotting the exon count frequency for the fruit fly genome as predicted by AUGUSTUS. To do this, we will use a histogram which groups count values into ranges such as 0-5, 6-10, etc. Histograms are not bar charts and typically display the bars together. The bars touch with no gaps in between representing a continuous series of values along the x axis. Excel Histogram Here’s a chart to start. This one (cropped) is the default histogram created in MS Excel and the only change was to the title. What problems do you see with this chart? What actions would you take to improve it? R Histogram Let’s make some changes! First let’s recreate the histogram with R and the ggplot2 library. Let’s add labels and a caption for our data source. If you think the ‘bins’ on the x axis are not quite to your liking, you can adjust them easily with ‘binwidth’. We’ll set the binwidth to 2. Let’s adjust the scales on the axes. This way we can see values more clearly and adjust the spacing to our preferred setting. We can make this look a lot better by diminishing the background and adding a pop of color. We can add a highlight to call attention to the frequency in the second bar (assuming this is important to the story). We can also increase font size and tweak the axes just a bit to limit the size of the unused white space. Further Reading Additional information is available in the works of many authors who focus on the field of information design, but you may do well to begin with an exploration of the following: Jacques Bertin Semiologie Graphique (Semiology of Graphics) Edward Tufte Visual Display of Quantitative Information Envisioning Information Visual Explanations Beautiful Evidence Scott McCloud Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art not info viz specifically!

["interactive-learning.html", "Interactive Learning", " Interactive Learning One of the best ways to learn about coding is to just try it out! Below are some resources for you to try so you can practice creating data visualizations with R. To do this, we can use online tools to communicate while you change the code to anything you like! Don’t be afraid of breaking it because you can always reload the page. Line Plot Figure 2: Credit: A. Santone Line plots are typically used when showing some kind of (semi?)continuous data over a continuous range, such as height over time, for example. The line represents both known values and unknown, assumed values in between data points. One visual advantage of line plots is they are ‘light weight’ meaning they do not occupy too much room on the plot. Let’s take a look at some R code for a line plot. This code uses the ‘tibble’ library for organizing the data in a well-formatted way, and ‘ggplot2’ to produce the graphics. The data are simulated (fake)! Your goal here is to change some variable names, data, color values, and other options to see what happens. Customize the plot so it looks good to you! Line plot with two series of data For additional help, check out this Quick Start Guide for Line Plots Bar Chart Figure 3: Credit: A. Santone Bar charts are great for displaying and comparing quantities such as before/after values or perhaps Group A scores versus Group B scores. Let’s take a look at some code to create a bar plot again based on the simulated (fake!) virus data over 10 weeks. Our goal this time is to compare the TOTAL number of infections from Virus A and Virus B. Because we are comparing two groups’ totals, a bar chart makes great sense. Again, think about what changes you might make to this plot and try to either delete, modify, or add features to the plot based on some code you have seen. Bar chart For additional help, check out this Quick Start Guide for Bar Charts Scatter Plots Figure 4: Credit: A. Santone Scatter plots excel when you’re interested in examining the relationship of two variables such as age and resting heart rate, height and weight, or some other pair of potentially correlated data. Beta-galactosidase Activity Part 1 Interactive Scatter plot with two series of data For additional help, check out this Quick Start Guide for Scatter Plots Box Plots Figure 5: Credit: A. Santone Box plots are used when you want to examine the distribution of data in one or more groups. Sometimes the average is just not enough information! So we can examine how the data are arranged around the mean. The “box” shows the quartiles of data above and below the mean while the “whiskers” show the other two quartiles. You can see if the data are tightly grouped near the mean or spread out very far. Box plot with two groups For additional help, check out this Quick Start Guide for Box Plots "],
